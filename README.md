# Nice Print DSV
A python project. Choose delimiter seperated value file, enter some changable parameters, and create a new file with nicely spaced items and colums for the purpose of printing. This program does not optimize things for a particular page size, so if your data has many rows but few columns, it will not place data into a new "column" on the empty side of the page and will instead simply run down to the next page.[1] Likewise if your data has to many columns or the columns are to wide, such that it will not fit on the width of a single page, the formatting will be completely ruined as a line that is to long will overflow into the next one.[2]
